We are using CVA to create a design system that is easy to use and maintain. It allows us to create a set of reusable
components that are easy to customise based on provided props. It also provides a set of utility functions that can be
used to create custom components. More information available at [CVA docs](https://cva.style/docs).

## ðŸ’» Environment Variables

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation
and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of
the expected type. Youâ€™ll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at `env.mjs`. Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your
project.
